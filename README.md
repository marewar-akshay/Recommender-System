# Recommender-System

Language Used: Java

Package used: Apache Mahout Package

Method used: Item-Item based collaborative filtering


This is a Data Mining Project. In an E-commerce application, we have n different customers potentially intending to buy m different commercial items. There are 943 users and 1682 items given and each user has given the ratings to some of the items but not for all items. 
The goal of Recommender System is to predict the missing rating values.

I used the Item-Item based collaborative filtering where I used Pearson based correlation to find the similarities between the items. And predicted the missing ratings based on the neighborhood.
